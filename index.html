        <div class="background-paragraph">
            <p>Hello! I'm currently a third-year student in the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS) program at the Technological University of the Philippines. Balancing my responsibilities as a working student, I’ve found that this dual commitment has pushed me to develop strong time management, dedication, and adaptability skills, which I carry into both my academic and professional environments.</p>
            <p>My studies have fostered a passion for understanding how information systems and data can address real-world problems. I've delved into areas like database management, system analysis, and web development, which has given me a strong technical foundation. I'm particularly drawn to the idea of using technology to streamline processes, enhance decision-making, and ultimately create positive impacts on both businesses and individuals.</p>
            <p>In the future, I aim to further expand my skills, both technically and professionally, by exploring emerging trends and innovations in the tech world. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the industry, combining my growing expertise with a genuine enthusiasm for continuous learning and personal development. Whether through projects, collaborations, or professional roles, I'm excited to embrace opportunities that will allow me to make a difference in the evolving tech landscape.</p>

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>I really love playing single player games, like Red Dead Redemption, God of War, Resident Evil, and so many more. To me, these kinds of games deliver a combination of interactive gameplay, along with storytelling that's so fully immersive, it's almost like an interactive movie. There's something just so appealing about this kind of game where I can explore worlds vividly detailed, make choices, and shape my own journey.</p>
          <p>I love the stories themselves in these games. Each one gives a different storyline and draws me into tight survival horror from Resident Evil or the storyline that Kratos had to carry in God of War. The depth in character developments with emotional arcs was already keeping me engaged, and I found it enhanced gameplay mechanics made it even more enjoyable. I believe it's a game, just becoming completely lost in a world, deciding how to make choices which indeed have a sense in one's life. The finest way for me was to unwind and challenge myself while savoring a profound, fully immersive experience.</p>
          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>My most-favorite genres have to be rock, punk, and alternative. My favorite bands have to be The Smashing Pumpkins, Pixies, Weezer, and The Beatles. Their music carries that ageless feeling blended with strong riffs, deep lyrics, and melodies I can identify at different levels.</p>
          <p>I wake up every morning and listen to music on Spotify, discovering new tracks, and discovering artists every day. One thing that really gets me excited is when a song says it for me-be it from some popular band, an up-and-coming indie group or otherwise. The variety of genres and types of music makes the library stay fresh and interesting. It has become somewhat of a necessity in my daily routine-whether at work, relaxing, or at just the right moment. It was a wonderful experience to hear different emotions, experiences, and concepts through sound.</p>
          <h3>Guitar</h3>
          <p>I would say that I always had a connection to music, which brought me to the activity of learning to play the guitar. These have always been an interest I had, and so after saving up some money, I could finally buy my own instrument. I needed this because I wanted to be able to recreate songs that I love so much. An avid music lover, it's quite rewarding being able to play those iconic guitar riffs and melodies.</p>
