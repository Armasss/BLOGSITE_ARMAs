        <div class="background-paragraph">
            <p>Hello! I am presently a third-year student for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Information Systems at the Technological University of the Philippines. Being a working student keeps one balancing academic studies, jobs, and personal chores, but this helped in the development of strength in time management, dedication, and adaptability, which really help me in both my academic and professional environments.</p>
            <p>Information systems and data, through studies, can solve real issues, especially in the fields of database management, system analysis, or even web development. The concerns that have made these be up on my head, only at the same time have made me more proficient technically, because I am actually fascinated by the use of technology with an aim of streamlining processes and enhancing decision-making capacity and finally impact businesses in positive ways while benefiting the people.</p>
            <p>Through these future years, I will embark on a more advanced step in my technical and professional competencies by going into new trends and innovations within the tech world. I look forward to contributing considerably to the industry by matching my continuously growing knowledge with genuine enthusiasm for continuous learning and self-improvement. Whether through projects, collaborations, or professional roles, I welcome opportunities for making a difference in the ever-changing Tech landscape.</p>

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>I really love playing single player games, like Red Dead Redemption, God of War, Resident Evil, and so many more. To me, these kinds of games deliver a combination of interactive gameplay, along with storytelling that's so fully immersive, it's almost like an interactive movie. There's something just so appealing about this kind of game where I can explore worlds vividly detailed, make choices, and shape my own journey.</p>
          <p>I love the stories themselves in these games. Each one gives a different storyline and draws me into tight survival horror from Resident Evil or the storyline that Kratos had to carry in God of War. The depth in character developments with emotional arcs was already keeping me engaged, and I found it enhanced gameplay mechanics made it even more enjoyable. I believe it's a game, just becoming completely lost in a world, deciding how to make choices which indeed have a sense in one's life. The finest way for me was to unwind and challenge myself while savoring a profound, fully immersive experience.</p>
          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>My most-favorite genres have to be rock, punk, and alternative. My favorite bands have to be The Smashing Pumpkins, Pixies, Weezer, and The Beatles. Their music carries that ageless feeling blended with strong riffs, deep lyrics, and melodies I can identify at different levels.</p>
          <p>I wake up every morning and listen to music on Spotify, discovering new tracks, and discovering artists every day. One thing that really gets me excited is when a song says it for me-be it from some popular band, an up-and-coming indie group or otherwise. The variety of genres and types of music makes the library stay fresh and interesting. It has become somewhat of a necessity in my daily routine-whether at work, relaxing, or at just the right moment. It was a wonderful experience to hear different emotions, experiences, and concepts through sound.</p>
          <h3>Guitar</h3>
          <p>I would say that I always had a connection to music, which brought me to the activity of learning to play the guitar. These have always been an interest I had, and so after saving up some money, I could finally buy my own instrument. I needed this because I wanted to be able to recreate songs that I love so much. An avid music lover, it's quite rewarding being able to play those iconic guitar riffs and melodies.</p>
          <p>Every time I go to play my guitar, I feel I'm getting closer to really understanding the music that inspires me. Not just playing the notes but trying to capture the essence of the songs and make them mine. Whether it is recording my favorite songs or doing experiments of mine, the guitar stands for a creative expression of my passion for music. It is also really enjoyable because every minute benefits me; I keep on extending my skills and grasp new techniques. Playing the guitar has become a satisfying part of my routine and opens the floodgates to the world of music.</p>
